# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

The project revolves around detection of diseases in the leaves of a plant. An algorithm has been written for detection of diseased and a healthy plant which 
works on classification of both the types of plant. A python code has been made using the 
reference paper attached. We have taken into mind the algorithm 
followed in the research paper and made it better and improved the accuracy.

Also a comparision report has been attached which compared the proposed methodology with the methodology proposed in the paper. we have trained the models using Logistic Regression, LDA, KNeighbours 
Classification, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification and Gaussian 
Na√Øve Bayes and the last algorithm of machine learning used in the training is Support 
Vector Machine
